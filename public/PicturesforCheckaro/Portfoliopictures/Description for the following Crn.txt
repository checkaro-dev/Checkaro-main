   Commenet :-Krishna from Checkaro did the inspection for our new house. The process was super detailed – took around 5 hours. They checked every tile, paint finish, and even toilet slopes. Found that all toilets had slope issues, which we flagged to the builder.Really helpful service!
3. CH-07E999 ( Pre- Purchase Inspection )    Alladi's Residence - "Software Engineer"
   Comment :- Absolutely worth it!I recently bought a 3600 sft triplex villa worth ₹2.5 Cr and thought everything was perfect—until the team from Checkaro did a full inspection. They uncovered 24+ hidden issues that could’ve cost me ₹3-4lakhs down the line. Thanks to their detailed report, I was able to get the builder to fix everything free of cost before moving in. As a software professional, I highly recommend Checkaro for anyone investing in property. It’s a small step that saved me big time!

5. CH-07E936 ( pre - purchase inspection ) Bangaraju Villa - "Business owner"
   Comment:- I took the Standard Package from Checkaro Home Inspection before starting interiors, and it was a great decision. On my interior designer's suggestion, I went for it—they used advanced German & US tech tools to detect issues like termites, broken tiles, floor slope errors, and wall leakage. Very professional team with a detailed report. Highly recommend for new homeowners!
